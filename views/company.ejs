                Over a decade ago, VCT embraced the challenge of unleashing the
                powerful potential inherent in aerodynamically controlling the
                vortices emanating from the aft fuselage of aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through a combination of analytical and empirical methods
                involving computational fluid dynamics (CFD), wind tunnel and
                flight test data, VCT has successfully developed patented
                technologies that control vortices, reducing an aircraft
                operator's carbon emissions and fuel consumption.
